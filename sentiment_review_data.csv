"SEIZURE RISK!!!! I have had this app for years and recommended it to many people, as it worked perfectly for me.

"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date.

I really wanted to like this app but there is no way to order items on todo lists.

Used to be simple well organized app. Latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your data....

"I rely on this app daily for all my personal to do lists. But recent changes to functionality have made it less friendly to use than when I first got it.  For example it's much harder to add a time.

Another annoyance is I can never use the word ""march"" in a task (like the March for Science) because the app thinks I mean the month.

Over all a great app but I have tasks in Google calendar that are set to repeat every 4 weeks but when I sync them to Todoist they adjust to repeat weekly which is frustrating because they needlessly fill up my inbox. I have reported the issue as a ticket but I haven't yet received a reply. If they fix that I will happily buy an annual subscription (currently just trying it for one month).,over all a great app but i have tasks in google calendar that are set to repeat every  weeks but when i sync them to todoist they adjust to repeat weekly which is frustrating because they needlessly fill up my inbox i have reported the issue as a ticket but i havent yet received a reply if they fix that i will happily buy an annual subscription currently just trying it for one month,0.1,0.052,0.848,0.5574,positive

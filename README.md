**Background:** In today's digital era, mobile applications are an important part of the daily lives of smartphone users. One of the more popular apps used to manage tasks and lists is Todoist. This application allows users to manage schedules, create to-do lists, set reminders, and much more. To understand the user's view of this application, sentiment analysis of user reviews on Google Playstore is important.

**Objective:** The aim of this project is to carry out a sentiment analysis of the Todoist app reviews received from users on the Google Playstore. Through this analysis, we can understand whether the views of users in general tend to be positive, negative, or neutral towards this application. In addition, we can identify specific aspects that users might highlight, both positive and negative, which can provide app developers with valuable insights in improving the user experience.

**Data:** The data used in this project comes from user reviews taken from Google Playstore. This data includes attributes such as review ID, username, review content, review score, time of review, version of the app when the review was created, and more. This data has been scraped from Twitter using a special scraping application. The data is then stored in a tabular format using the relevant columns for sentiment analysis.

By conducting a sentiment analysis of these Todoist app reviews, we can gain valuable insight into how users view the app as a whole. This information can assist application developers in identifying application strengths and weaknesses, as well as provide a solid basis for decision-making in improving the user experience.

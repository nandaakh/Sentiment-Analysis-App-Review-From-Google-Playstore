Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom.

One cool thing about this app is that you can add your accountability partner and then keep track of each other's goals. The only drawback is that Microsoft has restricted it to outlook/Microsoft users.

One cool thing about this app is that you can add your accountability partner and then keep track of each other's goals. The only drawback is that Microsoft has restricted it to outlook/Microsoft users.

Repeating reminders seem to work for a couple days and then it stops pushing reminders to my phone. It's very disappointing. I use this for grocery and other lists.

MS doesn't deserve the recognition for most of these - most came from the IP they bought. However, there's some incredibly frustrating issues with this app. I'm frustrated that they took over Wunderlist (a standalone, single purpose app) and integrated it into the office suite. I've searched high and low but there's just nothing out there like Wunderlist so now we're forced into the MS ecosystem. Sadly another example of great IP being gobbled up by the big guy so that they can force you into their ecosystem. - When my phone OS updates (Google Pixel lineup) it frequently breaks my recurring reminders. THIS IS A SUPER SERIOUS PROBLEM. When you use a reminder app to build routines, you expect that it's going to function 100% of the time. If not, why even bother with the app? - There are frequent issues with the way it synchronizes with Outlook. Besides, I don't want it to synchronize with Outlook and I'd like an option to disable this. I want it to be exclusive to my phone. If MS can get their act together and bring reliability to this app I will happily improve my rating. Until then, they lose nearly all stars. A reminder app MUST be reliable at all times, not a week after an OS update is released and they decide to finally fix the bugs in their app. If I'm constantly worried it's not working then I'm wasting time and energy, not to mention potentially missing something important.

Add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top. 3. Marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list.

Microsoft To-Do is by no means a full-blown task manager. However, the longer I use it, the easier it fits into my routine.

Main issues:  - The Reminder/Snooze feature need mores work. The Snooze time seems to be broken. Can set 1 hour, but it still comes back in 5 min. Reminders create both To-Do app notifications and Windows 10 notifications. This gets annoying if you have more than one reminder set.    Wish list:  - I would like all unfinished tasks with the My Day flag to retain the May Day flag tomorrow. For me, this more closely matches how I used to roll-forward unfinished tasks on paper. It will save me extra steps each day.   - I would like to bulk-load Steps by cutting/pasting a list of steps from Excel or other external program - As an Office 365 user, I'd like to see more and better sharing/embedding integration between Office programs (e.g. Outlook 2016, OneNote, etc.) and the store apps like Microsoft To-Do.",3,2,1.49.101,2019-02-07 00:39:45,,,1.49.101,most_relevant,com.microsoft.todos

I suggest allowing a ""pause"" feature for these types of situations where a disturbance is quite important. Now, I understand that people may take advantage of the pause feature, thus ruining the very purpose of the app. This is why I suggest a limited number of pauses, likely one or two allowed per day or per week.

I deleted the app during a period of no study as I needed some space on my phone for updates. Now that I am back at school and need to revise, I re-downloaded the app. However, I deleted it almost immediately after, when I discovered that whitelisting is no longer a free feature. I used to use this feature to allow myself to listen to Spotify or use particular apps on my phone to support my studies. I cannot afford to pay for the full version as I am too young to get a job and I will not ask my parents to get it for me, so not being able to access that feature for free has put me off using this app as a timer. It's a shame because this app was something that was beautifully constructed and easy to use, but this change in access has hindered my ability to use it.",3,0,4.0.5,2018-10-05 15:56:24,"Hi,

If I can't do it at that time it gives me the option to snooze the pop up for anytime.
